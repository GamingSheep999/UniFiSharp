# UniFiSharp

_Bringing Ubiquiti UniFi Orchestration Automation to C#_

UniFiSharp provides a basic C# API for Ubiquiti UniFi controllers, as well as an orchestration overlay to more easily visualize network topology and execute device commands. UniFiSharp also implements both v1 and v2 of the Ubiquiti discovery protocol for automated controller discovery.

As of v1.5, UniFiSharp ships with `unifi-cli`, a cross-platform command-line tool which allows CLI access to the functionality of UniFiSharp. This tool is packaged as a stand-alone executable which does not require the NET CLR to be installed on the target system.
