# What is UniFiSharp?
UniFiSharp provides a basic C# API for Ubiquiti UniFi controllers, as well as an orchestration overlay to more easily visualize network topology and execute device commands. UniFiSharp also implements both v1 and v2 of the Ubiquiti discovery protocol for automated controller discovery.

This project is wrfitten for any .NET application that can consume a .NET Standard 2.1 library. All future contributions are planned to continue to enable cross-platform use.

> **NOTE:** NET Standard 2.0 support was dropped in v1.4.1.
